## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1] - 2026-08-21

The foundation. Nothing to play with yet; everything to build on.

### Added

- Multi-module Maven build (Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5) split into domain, application, and
  persistence / web / security adapters, with a single composition root.
- Layering enforced two ways: `engine-domain` and `engine-application` declare no framework
  dependencies, so a Spring import into either fails the build at the enforcer; ArchUnit covers
  dependency direction, framework types in the inner layers, and field injection.
- The wave JSON Schema as the single source of truth at `contracts/schemas/wave/v1.json`,
  copied into the jar at build time, with a conformance test that validates every sample
  against it.
- Three CC0 demo waves.
- A deny-by-default baseline security chain. Only the health, info and metrics endpoints and
  the API documentation are reachable; everything else is denied until identity lands.
- `/actuator/health`, `/actuator/info`, `/actuator/prometheus`, and OpenAPI at `/api-docs`
  with Swagger UI at `/docs`.
- `docker compose up` quickstart with Postgres.
- CI running the full test suite, secret scanning and CodeQL on every push and pull request.
